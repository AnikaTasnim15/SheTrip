  <h1>Verify Before Meeting</h1>
  <p>Before you meet someone from the community, follow these checks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Check their profile: verified badges, reviews, and completed trips.</li>
    <li>Confirm identity via social links or phone verification when possible.</li>
    <li>Arrange to meet in a public place and share the meet time with friends.</li>
    <li>Set a short check-in time with the person and make sure your emergency contacts know the plan.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If anything feels off, cancel the meet and report the profile.</p>
