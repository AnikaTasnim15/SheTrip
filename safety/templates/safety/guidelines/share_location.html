  <h1>Share Your Location</h1>
  <p>Sharing your live location with a trusted contact can increase your safety when meeting someone in person.</p>
  <h3>How to share safely</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a trusted app (Google Maps, Apple Find My, WhatsApp live location) to share with one or two trusted contacts.</li>
    <li>Only share for the period you expect to be in transit or at the meeting location.</li>
    <li>Do not share your location publicly; only share with a verified friend or family member.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you can't share live location, send your planned route and expected arrival time to your contact.</p>
</div>
